# Flash Flood Guidance System Risk Analyzer
This is a Tethys 2/3 compatible app that helps determine risk of flooding based on the Flash Flood Guidance System using the GFS and WRF forecasts as inputs for precipitation depths.

Â© [Riley Hales](http://rileyhales.com) and [Chris Edwards](https://github.com/chris3edwards3/), 2019. Based on the [GLDAS Data Visualizer](https://github.com/rileyhales/gldas) and the [GFS Visualization Tool](https://github.com/rileyhales/gfs). Developed at the BYU Hydroinformatics Lab.
